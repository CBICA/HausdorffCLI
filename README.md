# test_hausdorff

## Purpose

Create a CLI that calculates Hausdorff-95 distance for 2 binary images.

## Points for consideration

- Leverage https://github.com/loli/medpy
- 2 inputs: 1 reference annotation (i.e., ground truth) and 1 annotation for comparison
- 1 output: a floating point number representing the Hausdorff distance
